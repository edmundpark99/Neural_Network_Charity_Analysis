# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

**Overview**

The main purpose of this analysis was to utilize machine learning alongside neural networks to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if they apply to a given program, in this case, Alphabet Soup. We utilized a dataset with nearly 34,000 applicant organizations funded by this program and performed a neural network analysis to analyze the data.
